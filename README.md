# Response Plots

## Figure 1: Motor 1 - Kp = 0.012

  This is the plot with the original parameters for motor 1
 

## Figure 2: Motor 2 - Kp = 0.012

  This is the plot with the original parameters for motor 2


## Changing the period
We now changed the period for both motors, causing it delay the reaction times. This created a negative effect to our motors because it takes longer to create the measurements, thus, allowing the motor to travel a farther distance than wanted. This can be seen by observing the difference between Figures 1 and 2 and Figures 3 and 4. 

## Figure 3: Motor 1 - Kp = 0.012

  This is the plot with the new parameters for motor 1

## Figure 4: Motor 2 - Kp = 0.012
![motor2_After](/motor1_2.png)

  This is the plot with the new parameters for motor 2
